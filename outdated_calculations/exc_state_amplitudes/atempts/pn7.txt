 ENTERING *** REDUCED MATRIX ELEMENTS (RMEGEN) ***

 Enter input file unit: 
15
 =>   15
 
 Enter input file name: 
pn7
 =>    pn7                 
 =>    hwsw.pn7            
 =>    opbw.pn7            
 =>    rmew.pn7            
 =>    hwsir.pn7           
 
 Enter log file unit number:
       0: none
     1-3: some intermediate results
     >=7: all intermediate results
0
 =>    0
 
 Enter number of multiplicity for one level:
2
 =>    2
 Enter operator structure:
       0: read everything from the file
       1: read a+ only from the file
     >=2: generate everything on the fly
 
0
 =>    0
 Enter # of a+_s, a_s:
1 1
 =>    1    1
 
 Enter the tensor character of operators:
       0: L=0 --> scalar
       1: L=1 --> vector
    else: all tensors
2
 =>    2
 
 Do you want limited numbers of (lm mu)?
 (0 for no, 1 for yes)
0
 =>    0
 
 Enter minimum (lm mu):
0 0
 =>    0    0
 
 Enter maximum (lm mu):
1000 1000
 => 1000 1000
 
 lm = mu ?
0
 =>    0
